# PyLiveOsc
This is a work in progess project to send OSC data from a BNO085 IMU sensor to Ableton Live's API, potentially allowing movement, orientation, and positional data to control features of a performance. Currently, the MCU used is a Raspberry Pi Pico 2040, connected to the BNO085 IMU sensor via I2C.
